Slicer 4 extension for facilitating radiology review of multiparametric MRI
data. Work in progress. Contact: fedorov@bwh.harvard.edu

This module will prompt the user for the location of the input data, provide
the list of available studies, for the selected study, will list the available
series and prompt the user for the series that need to be loaded. The selected
series will be loaded into Slicer, and displayed in a layout that shows each
series in a separate viewport. The user can then select the series on which to
perform segmentation, and can proceed with this task using Editor module. The
resulting segmentations will be saved in the input directory hierarchy following
the implementation conventions.

This extension makes a number of assumptions in interpreting the data, and
aims to follow these conventions:

1) the image data is derived from DICOM, and the meta-data is available

2) the user-defined input directory is assumed to have the following structure:

 InputLocation
   |
   -- Study
      |
      -- RESOURCES
         |
         -- SeriesNumber
            |
            -- Reconstructions
               |
               -- <SeriesNumber>.nrrd   <-- image volume in NRRD format
               -- <SeriesNumber>.xml    <-- output of the dcm2xml tool to
                                            an image from this series
            |
            -- Segmentations
               |
               -- <SeriesNumber>.nrrd

3) segmentations produced by the user will be saved at the same level as
 Reconstructions in Segmentations directory. Segmentation label will be saved
 as <SeriesNumber>.nrrd. NOTE: this approach currently does not support multiple
 segmentations per series (e.g., multiple users, multiple readings). This was not
 required at the time, and assumption of single segmentation image per series
 makes the implementation and user interaction simpler.
